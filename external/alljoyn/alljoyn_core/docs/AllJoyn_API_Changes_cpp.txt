    SetLinkTimeoutAsync().
    
CHANGED METHOD
ajn::BusAttachment.BusAttachment(const char* applicationName, 
                                 bool allowRemoteMessages = false, 
                                 uint32_t concurrency = 4)
    Construct a BusAttachment.

    [param] applicationName     - Name of the application.
    [param] allowRemoteMessages - True if this attachment is allowed to receive 
                                  messages from remote devices.
    [param] concurrency         - The maximum number of concurrent method and 
                                  signal handlers locally executing.

NEW METHOD
ajn::BusAttachment.GetConcurrency()
    Get the concurrent method and signal handler limit.

NEW METHOD
ajn::BusAttachment.EnableConcurrentCallbacks()
    Allow the currently executing method/signal handler to enable concurrent 
    callbacks during the scope of the handler's execution.

NEW METHOD
ajn::BusAttachment.SetLinkTimeoutAsync(SessionId sessionid,
                                       uint32_t linkTimeout,
                                       BusAttachment::SetLinkTimeoutAsyncCB* callback,
                                       void* context = NULL)
    Set the link timeout for a session.

    Link timeout is the maximum number of seconds that an unresponsive 
    daemon-to-daemon connection will be monitored before declaring the session 
    lost (via SessionLost callback). Link timeout defaults to 0 which indicates 
    that AllJoyn link monitoring is disabled.

    Each transport type defines a lower bound on link timeout to avoid defeating 
    transport specific power management algorithms.

    This call executes asynchronously. When the JoinSession response is received, 
    the callback will be called.

    [param] sessionid     Id of session whose link timeout will be modified.
    [param] linkTimeout   Max number of seconds that a link can be unresponsive 
                          before being declared lost. 0 indicates that AllJoyn 
                          link monitoring will be disabled. On return, this value 
                          will be the resulting (possibly upward) adjusted 
                          linkTimeout value that acceptable to the underlying 
                          transport.
    [param]  callback     Called when SetLinkTimeout response is received.
    [param]  context      User defined context which will be passed as-is to callback.

NEW METHOD
ajn::BusAttachment.GetLinkTimeoutResponse(Message& reply, uint32_t& timeout)
    Validate the response to SetLinkTimeout

NEW METHOD
ajn::BusAttachment.GetJoinSessionResponse(Message& reply, SessionId& sessionId, SessionOpts& opts)

                                void* context = NULL)
    Add a method handler to this object. The interface for the method handler 
    must have already been added by calling AddInterface().

    [param] member  - Interface member implemented by handler.
    [param] handler - Method handler.
    [param] context - An optional context. This is mainly intended for 
                      implementing language bindings and should normally be NULL.

NEW VIRTUAL METHOD
ajn::BusObject.CallMethodHandler(MessageReceiver::MethodHandler handler, 
                                 const InterfaceDescription::Member* member, 
                                 Message& message, void* context)
    This method can be overridden to provide access to the context registered in 
    the AddMethodHandler() call.

    [param] member  - The method being called.
    [param] handler - The handler to call.
    [param] message - The message containing the method call arguments.
    [param] context - NULL or a private context passed in when the method handler 
                      was registered.

NEW METHOD

    SetLinkTimeout failed

NEW STATUS
ER_ALLJOYN_ACCESS_PERMISSION_WARNING value = 0x90a3 
    No permission to use Wifi/Bluetooth

NEW STATUS
ER_ALLJOYN_ACCESS_PERMISSION_ERROR value = 0x90a4 
    No permission to access peer service

NEW STATUS
ER_BUS_DESTINATION_NOT_AUTHENTICATED value = 0x90a5 
    Cannot send a signal to a destination that is not authenticated

NEW ALLJOYN METHOOD
Interface: org.alljoyn.Bus
Method: SetLinkTimeout(uint32_t sessionId, uint32_t linkTimeout)
    Input params:
    sessionId   - Id of session whose link timeout will be modified.
 
    linkTimeout - Max number of seconds that a link can be unresponsive before being
                  declared lost. 0 indicates that AllJoyn link monitoring will be disabled.

    Output params:              
    disposition      - One of the ALLJOYN_SETLINKTMEOUT_* dispositions listed below
    replyLinkTimeout - On successful disposition, this value will contain the resulting
                                   (possibly upward) adjusted linkTimeout value that is acceptable
                                   to the underlying transport.

NEW ALLJOYN METHOD
Interface: org.alljoyn.Bus
Method: AliasUnixUser(uint32_t aliasUID)
 Input params:
     aliasUID - The alias user id.
 
 Output params:
    disposition - One of the ALLJOYN_ALIASUNIXUSER_* dispositions

NEW METHOD
ajn::AuthListener.SetExpiration(uint32_t expiration)
    Sets an expiration time in seconds relative to the current time for the credentials. This value is optional and
    can be set on any response to a credentials request. After the specified expiration time has elapsed any secret
    keys based on the provided credentials are invalidated and a new authentication exchange will be required. If an
    expiration is not set the default expiration time for the requested authentication mechanism is used.
    
    [param] expiration - The expiration time in seconds.

NEW METHOD
ajn::AuthListener.GetExpiration()
    Get the expiration time in seconds if it is set.

NEW METHOD
ajn::BusAttachment.Stop()
    Stop the message bus.
    
    Ask the threading subsystem in the bus attachment to begin the
    process of ending the execution of its threads.
    
    The Stop() method call on a bus attachment should be thought of as
    mapping to a threading package stop function.  It asks the BusAttachment
    to begin shutting down its various threads of execution, but does not
    wait for any threads to exit.
    
    A call to Stop() is implied as one of the first steps in the destruction
    of a bus attachment.
    
    [warning] There is no guarantee that a listener callback may begin executing
    after a call to Stop().  To achieve that effect, the Stop() must be followed
    by a Join().
    
    [see] ajn::BusAttachment.Start()
    [see] ajn::BusAttachment.Join()

REMOVED METHOD
ajn::BusAttachment.Stop(bool blockUntilStopped = true)
    Stop the message bus.
    
    [param] blockUntilStopped - Block the caller until the bus is stopped

NEW METHOD
ajn::BusAttachment.Join()
    Wait for all of the threads spawned by the bus attachment to be
    completely exited.
    
    A call to the Join() method should be thought of as mapping to a
    threading package join function call.  It blocks and waits until all of
    the threads in the BusAttachment have, in fact, exited their Run functions,
    gone through the stopping state and have returned their status.  When
    the Join() method returns, one may be assured that no threads are running
    in the bus attachment, and therefore there will be no callbacks in
    progress and no further callbacks will ever come out of the instance of a
    bus attachment on which Join() was called.
    
    A call to Join() is implied as one of the first steps in the destruction
    of a bus attachment.  Thus, when a bus attachment is destroyed, it is
    guaranteed that before it completes its destruction process, there will be
    no callbacks in process.
    
    [warning] If Join() is called without a previous Stop() it will result in
              blocking "forever."
    
    [see] Start()
    [see] Stop()

REMOVED METHOD 
ajn::BusAttachment.WaitStop()
    Wait for the message bus to be stopped. This method blocks the calling thread until another thread
    calls the Stop() method. Return immediately if the message bus has not been started.
    
CHANGED METHOD
ajn::BusAttachment.GetUniqueName() const;
    Changed in 2.2 method now returns a qcc::String before it returned a qcc::String reference
    Get the unique name of this BusAttachment.

NEW METHOD
ajn::BusAttachment.SetKeyExpiration(const qcc::String& guid, uint32_t timeout)
    Set the expiration time on keys associated with a specific remote peer as identified by its
    peer GUID. The peer GUID associated with a bus name can be obtained by calling GetPeerGUID().
    If the timeout is 0 this is equivalent to calling ClearKeys().
    
    [param] guid    - The GUID of a remote authenticated peer.
    [param] timeout - The time in seconds relative to the current time to expire the keys.

NEW METHOD
ajn::BusAttachment.GetKeyExpiration(const qcc::String& guid, uint32_t& timeout)
    Get the expiration time on keys associated with a specific authenticated remote peer as
    identified by its peer GUID. The peer GUID associated with a bus name can be obtained by
    calling GetPeerGUID().
    
    [param] guid    - The GUID of a remote authenticated peer.
    [param] timeout - The time in seconds relative to the current time when the keys will expire.

NEW METHOD
ajn::BusAttachment.SetLinkTimeout(SessionId sessionid, uint32_t& linkTimeout)
    Set the link timeout for a session.
    
    Link timeout is the maximum number of seconds that an unresponsive daemon-to-daemon connection
    will be monitored before declaring the session lost (via SessionLost callback). Link timeout
    defaults to 0 which indicates that AllJoyn link monitoring is disabled.
    
    Each transport type defines a lower bound on link timeout to avoid defeating transport
    specific power management algorithms.
    
    [param] sessionid    - Id of session whose link timeout will be modified.
    [param] linkTimeout  - [IN/OUT] Max number of seconds that a link can be unresponsive before being
                           declared lost. 0 indicates that AllJoyn link monitoring will be disabled. On
                           return, this value will be the resulting (possibly upward) adjusted linkTimeout
                           value that acceptable to the underlying transport.

NEW METHOD
ajn::ProxyBusObject.SecureConnectionAsync(bool forceAuth = false)
    Asynchronously secure the connection to the remote peer for this proxy object. Peer-to-peer
    connections can only be secured if EnablePeerSecurity() was previously called on the bus
    attachment for this proxy object. If the peer-to-peer connection is already secure this
    function does nothing. Note that peer-to-peer connections are automatically secured when a
    method call or signal requiring encryption is sent or received.
    
    Notification of success or failure is via the AuthListener passed to EnablePeerSecurity().
    
    [param] forceAuth - If true, forces an re-authentication even if the peer connection is already

    If isDeep is true
    Create a deep (clone) copy of a managed object.
    A ManagedObject created using this constructor copies the underlying T
    object and wraps it in a new ManagedObject with 1 reference.
    
    if isDeep is false
    Do not make a deep copy of the managed object instead make a new reference
    to the existing object and increment the reference counter by +1.
    
    [param] other  - ManagedObject to make a copy of.
    [param] isDeep - Specify if this is a deep (clone) copy or a normal copy

NEW METHOD
ajn::ManagedObj.iden(const ManagedObj<T>& other) const
    Returns true if the two managed objects managed the same object
    [param] other - The other managed object to compare.
