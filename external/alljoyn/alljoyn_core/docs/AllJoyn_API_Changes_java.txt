NEW METHOD
BusAttachment.enableConcurrentCallbacks()
    Enable callbacks within the context of the currently executing method
    handler, signal handler or other AllJoyn callback.
    
    This method can ONLY be called from within the body of a signal handler,
    method handler or other AllJoyn callback. It allows AllJoyn to dispatch 
    a single (additional) callback while the current one is still executing.
    This method is typically used when a method, signal handler or other
    AllJoyn callback needs to execute for a long period of time or when the 
    callback needs to make any kind of blocking call.
    
    This method MUST be called prior to making any non-asynchronous AllJoyn 
    remote procedure calls from within an AllJoyn callback. This includes
    calls such as joinSession(), advertiseName(), cancelAdvertisedName(),
    findAdvertisedName(), cancelFindAdvertisedName(), setLinkTimeout(), etc.


NEW METHOD
BusListener.busDisconnected()
    Called when a BusAttachment this listener is registered with is has become 
    disconnected from the bus

NEW CONSTANT
SessionOpts.TRANSPORT_ICE
    Use only ICE transport to communicate with a given session

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AllJoyn API Changes between v2.1.0 and v2.2.0 (Java API)
NEW CLASS
Class ExpirationRequest added to AuthListener
    ExpirationRequest.setExpiration(int expiration)
        Sets an expiration time in seconds relative to the current time for
        the credentials. This value is optional and can be set on any
        response to a credentials request. After the specified expiration
        time has elapsed any secret keys based on the provided credentials
        are invalidated and a new authentication exchange will be
        required. If an expiration is not set the default expiration time for
        the requested authentication mechanism is used.
        [param] expiration - the expiration time in seconds

CHANGED METHOD
BusAttachment.joinSession(string, short, SessionOpts, SessionListener, OnJoinSessionListener, context)
    Asynchronous version of joinSession(string, short, Mutable.IntegerValue, SessionOpts, SessionListener)}.
    context param added in 2.2 release 
    [param] context - User-defined context object.  Passed through to OnJoinSessionListener.onJoinSession(Status, int, SessionOpts, Object).
    
NEW METHOD
BusAttachment.setLinkTimeout(int sessionId, Mutable.IntegerValue linkTimeout)
    Set the link timeout for a session.
    
    Link timeout is the maximum number of seconds that an unresponsive
    daemon-to-daemon connection will be monitored before declaring the
    session lost (via SessionLost callback). Link timeout defaults to 0 which
    indicates that AllJoyn link monitoring is disabled.
    
    Each transport type defines a lower bound on link timeout to avoid
    defeating transport specific power management algorithms.
    
    [param] sessionId   - Id of session whose link timeout will be modified.
    [param] linkTimeout - [IN/OUT] Max number of seconds that a link can be
                          unresponsive before being declared lost. 0 indicates
                          that AllJoyn link monitoring will be disabled. On
                          return, this value will be the resulting (possibly
                          upward) adjusted linkTimeout value that acceptable
                          to the underlying transport.

 NEW METHOD
 BusAttachment.release()
    Release resources immediately.
    
    Normally, when all references are removed to a given object, the Java
    garbage collector notices the fact that the object is no longer required
    and will destroy it.  This can happen at the garbage collector's leisure
    an so any resources held by the object will not be released until "some
    time later" after the object is no longer needed.
    
    Often, in test programs, we cycle through many BusAttachments in a very
    short time, and if we rely on the garbage collector to clean up, we can
    fairly quickly run out of scarce underlying resources -- especially file
    descriptors.
    
    We provide an explicitly release() method to allow test programs to release
    the underlying resources immediately.  The garbage collector will still
    call finalize, but the resources held by the underlying C++ objects will
    go away immediately.
    
    It is a programming error to call another method on the BusAttachment
    after the release() method has been called.
    
NEW METHOD
BusAttachment.setKeyExpiration(String guid, int timeout)
    Sets the expiration time on keys associated with a specific remote peer as identified by its
    peer GUID. The peer GUID associated with a bus name can be obtained by calling
    getPeerGUID(String, Mutable.StringValue).  If the timeout is 0 this is equivalent to calling
    clearKeys(String).
    
    [param] guid    - the GUID of a remote authenticated peer
    [param] timeout - the time in seconds relative to the current time to expire the keys

NEW METHOD
BusAttachment.getKeyExpiration(String guid, Mutable.IntegerValue timeout)
    Gets the expiration time on keys associated with a specific authenticated remote peer as
    identified by its peer GUID. The peer GUID associated with a bus name can be obtained by
    calling getPeerGUID(String, Mutable.StringValue).
    
    [param] guid    - the GUID of a remote authenticated peer
    [param] timeout - the time in seconds relative to the current time when the keys will expire

CHANGED METHOD
InterfaceDescription.addMember(int type, String name, String inputSig, String outSig, int annotation, String accessPerm)
    param accessPerm added for 2.2.0 release
    
NEW METHOD
ProxyBusObject.release()
    Release resources immediately.
     
    Normally, when all references are removed to a given object, the Java
    garbage collector notices the fact that the object is no longer required
    and will destory it.  This can happen at the garbage collector's leisure
    an so any resources held by the object will not be released until "some
    time later" after the object is no longer needed.
    
    Often, in test programs, we cycle through many BusAttachments in a very
    short time, and if we rely on the garbage collector to clean up, we can
    fairly quickly run out of scarce underlying resources -- especially file
    descriptors.
    
    We provide an explicitly release() method to allow test programs to release
    the underlying resources immediately.  The garbage collector will still
    call finalize, but the resources held by the underlying C++ objects will
    go away immediately.
    
    It is a programming error to call another method on the ProxyBusObject
    after the release() method has been called.

NEW METHOD
SessionListener.sessionMemberAdded(int sessionId, String uniqueName)
    Called by the bus for multipoint sessions when another node joins the session.
    
    [param] sessionId  - Id of multipoint session whose members have changed.
    [param] uniqueName - Unique name of member who joined the session.

NEW METHOD
SessionListener.sessionMemberRemoved(int sessionId, String uniqueName)
    Called by the bus for multipoint sessions when another node leaves the session.
    
    [param] sessionId  - Id of multipoint session whose members have changed.
    [param] uniqueName - Unique name of member who left the session.
    
NEW STATUS 
ALREADY_REGISTERED value="0xa004" 
    An AuthListener is already set on this BusAttachment
